    Upon the creation of Software RAID devices, component devices are
    sometimes kicked out immediately (for no apparent reason). This
    fix re-adds devices in such cases in order to prevent the component
    to be missing next time the device is assembled, which, for instance
    may prevent the UEFI ESPs to be installed properly.
