    The system file system configuration file for Linux machines, the
    ``/etc/fstab`` file is now updated to include a reference to the
    EFI partition in the case of a partition image base deployment.
    Without this reference, images deployed using partition images
    could end up in situations where upgrading the bootloader could fail.
